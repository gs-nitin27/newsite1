        	         <h4>Why should aspiring athletes suffer from the lack of information? Why should they be deprived of the opportunities that can help them realize their dreams? Amid all the talks of discrepancies in our sports system, let's not forget that the right & precise information also play an important part in an athlete's career. GetSporty is the platform that helps bridge that gap-</h4>
        	         <p>We assume that a talented athlete must never lose his wings for the sole reason of lack of information and opportunities. That's why we were keen to develop a unique source/platform which may create a much-needed transparency in the Indian sports system.</p>
        	         
        	         <p>GetSporty is an app where all the athletes can find the solutions for all their sports problems. From finding the coach to the best clubs and academies in his surrounding area, our unique product has all the attributes that make GetSporty a must-have sports companion. We donâ€™t care about our recognition but we want to see what good can come from our work rather than pointing a finger at the Indian sports structure. So don't ever get lost and give your dreams a flight of your imaginations. The last obstacle that an athlete can hope to negotiate is the unavailability of the required information at his disposal.</p>
        	         <div class="margin15"></div>
        	         <hr>
        	         <h4>Here are some features of our App:</h4>
        	         <p>The parents and the coaches can track the growth of their child through our specially built feature "Performance" in our App. The parents and the athletes will also have the luxury of finding the best coaches or trainers in their surrounding area. Our App also features all the information about the sports clubs and academies that provide the best training to the athletes. While a coach can browse through all the latest sports jobs that match his profile and can apply directly through our app.</p>
        	         <p>We are also well rehearsed in providing a quality content and enhance the user experience with a suite of app-based innovative products and services. Our App offers some really innovative and cool products and one of them is the "Performance Assessment feature". For example, we have developed a unique feature in our app where the parents will have all the information about their ward's performance during his practice session. The information will be filled by a coach after the end of the practice session. And based on that performance both the coach and the parents will know all about the performance and the development of that child in the field.</p>
        	         <p>In addition to this, our App also serves as the best interaction place for all the people related to the world of sports. For example, individual athletes and coaches can interact with each other directly through our portal. So don't get left behind in this fast-paced, fiercely competitive world of sport as these are only a few features of our app.</p>
        	         <p>The conclusion is that GetSporty is a dream App for all the people related to the world of sport. Whether you are an individual player, coach or the person related to the sports business, this unique app/product is a perfect novelty to own and is a must have to solve the dire problems related to the Indian sports system. It also helps the athletes (and parents) in keeping the track of their competitive performance and sports training. The App can also be customized as per user's preferences.</p>
